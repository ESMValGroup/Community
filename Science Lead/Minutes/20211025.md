## Topics

1. Brief report on 1st cross-team meeting (22 October 2021)
   * Agreement that meeting notes will be made available on https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community
   * Discussion and prioritizing of cross-team topics. These include:
      * Strategy / protocol for non-backward compatible changes
      * Strategy for “error tolerance” of the tool
      * Finding new reviewers / recipe maintainers
      * Keeping tutorial in sync with ongoing developments (including communication strategy)
2. General questions (e.g. strategy, interaction with other teams, releases, reviews of pull requests, etc.)
   * Brief discussion on how to deal with recipe maintainers that are not (regularly) part of the active
   development team any more. This could be a topic for the upcoming ESMValTool workshop in November 2021.
   * Meeting notes and other information from the science lead team will be moved from
     [ESMValTool wiki](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/wiki/Science-lead-development-team) to
