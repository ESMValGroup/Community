## Topics

1. Welcome Julien Lenhardt (@jlenh) to the Science Lead Development Team as new member

2. Science strategy for archiving/retiring outdated/unused recipes

   * Discussion of adjusting/extending broken recipe Policy [https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/community/broken_recipe_policy.html]
   * Current policy:
      - Broken recipe and diagnostic code are removed from the ESMValTool main branch
      - Scientific documentation of the recipe (and diagnostics) will be kept in the user and developer guide with an additional note and link to the last release in which the recipe was still fully functional
      - Policy does not cover the case of removing unused/outdated recipes/diagnostics from the testing and maintenance framework of the tool
   * Idea:
      - Introducing an "archive" folder in the ESMValTool repository (with subfolders "recipes" and "diagnostic_scripts")
      - Possibility to move broken/unused/outdated recipes and/or diagnostic scripts to this new folder (instead of deleting the code)
      - Reasons:
         - Make sure diagnostics and recipes that have been advertised in presentations and papers remain part of the ESMValTool distribution (as "inactive" components)
         - Ensure long-term and easiest possible access to old code for scientists
         - Make maintenance and testing of the tool as well as releases easier by retiring unused/outdated recipes (by the recipe maintainer)
      - Examples include recipes relying on CMIP5 data that are not available any more, the NCL-based "perfmetrics" package or @schlunma â€™s paper from 2020
   * Special care has to be taken when retiring diagnostic scripts to avoid breaking of other diagnostics / recipes
   * The science team is in favor of this idea
      - @schlunma will report this idea at the next meeting of the Technical Lead Development Team
      - Way forward is to open a pull request to adapt/extend the broken recipe policy
   * Need to have a final decision very soon

3. Restructuring the categories of recipes in the documentation
   * Ideas for restructuring the recipe documentation:
      - No fixed categories (as it is now), but providing key words instead; could be physical properties, methods, etc.
      - Possibly use tags from the recipes so that we could have tabs to find recipes/diagnostics in the documentation? Not sure if/how this would work with Sphinx.
      - Going away from documenting by recipe, focusing on the diagnostics instead
      - Two different categories: specific papers and general purpose diagnostics
   * Add option to document archived-only recipes (e.g. made available via Zenodo only, not as part of ESMValTool release)

4. Preparing and potentially coding of diagnostics/recipes for the CMIP7 REF
   * See also [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues/3824]
   * ESMValTool is the only European tool to be represented in the CMIP7 Rapdid Evaluation Framework (REF) for analyzing CMIP7 data as they come in
   * Official launch was in November 2024
   * @bouweandela is our representative
   * Some of the (proposed) diagnostics and/or suitable recipes do not exist yet --> some coding required
   * Dead line for providing the diagnostics and recipes is end of February 2025
   * Some list items (GitHub issue #3824) need to be more concrete
   * Idea: add a tag or create a project to mark relevant PRs (e.g. high-priority review)
   * Finding reviewers for PRs: use mailing list as additional channel to look for reviewers
   * Special release for REF?
