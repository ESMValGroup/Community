## Topics

1. Dividing recipes into different categories
   * documentation recipes for specific applications (for peer-reviewed papers)
   * general recipes that can be applied to arbitrary data
   * aim: reducing work load for releases and make it easier for new users to find suitable recipes

2. Finding new members
   * Number of active members in the science lead development team is small
     - risk of loosing momentum
     - number of institutes actively represented decreased
     - new members would be desireable
   * potential new members are proposed and discussed at the next team meeting
   * @pepcos has been proposed as new member
