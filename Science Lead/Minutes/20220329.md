# 4th science lead development team meeting, 29 March 2022

## Important outcomes

* recommendation to improve the installation documentation, possibly with instructions for
  different target groups; @zklaus will bring up this topic at the next meeting of the
  technical lead development team
* science lead team will start a list of NCL diagnostics that would need to be converted to
  Python (or R) before NCL stops working (including priority); see
  https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions/2617
* scientific long-term strategy will be discussed at the next ESMValTool workshop

## List of attendees

## Topics

1. ESMValTool release v2.5
   * Feedback, lessons learned, suggestions
     - release went very smoothly
     - communication on dates for feature freeze (tool) could be improved, in particular when
       release of core has been delayed
     - as a side note: installation instructions could be improved by giving specific instructions for
       different target groups; @zklaus will bring up this topic at the next meeting of the
       technical lead development team
     - big thanks to @remi-kazeroni and @schlunma for their work as release managers
2. Brief report on cross-team meeting (28 March 2022)
   * Status strategy for backward compatibility (https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/discussions/7)
     - discussion is still open until 15 April 2022
     - afterwards, a small team of 4-5 people will work on a document to be discussed at the next
       ESMValTool workshop
     - if interested in joining this team please contact @alistairsellar
   * Status contributor license agreement (CLA)
     - CLA almost finished
     - technical lead team will start looking into implementing a CLA into the GitHub workflow
   * Status ESMValTool governance
     - document almost finished
     - contact people from each participating institute need to be named soon
   * Long-term scientific strategy regarding existing recipes and diagnostics
     - see discussion item 3 below
   For details see also meeting notes of cross-team meeting from 28 March
   2022 available at https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/tree/main/Cross%20Team
3. Scientific long-term strategy
   * Main aim of the tool (all recipes fully functional, all recipes can be applied to new datasets,
     recipe archive, etc.) and strategy for contributions with no maintainer
     (e.g. non-backward compatible changes)
     - first thoughts of a long-term science strategy for the tool have been discussed including the main
       aim of the tool and a potential strategy for dealing with broken recipes that do not have an active
       maintainer (see slide attached below)
     - a clarification of which tasks are expected from a recipe maintainer would be needed
     - there is a link with the discussion on backward compatibility (see item 2)
     - a suite of general diagnostics (such as map plots, time series, histograms, pdfs, zonal means, etc.)
       might be useful; existing diagnostics could be made more visible by adding extra documentation for
       a collection of such basic diagnostics
     - this topic will be discussed in a dedicated session at the next ESMValTool workshop
   * Future of NCL diagnostics, list of diagnostics to be converted from NCL to other language
     - for technical reasons, it might not be feasible in the future to include NCL in the current ESMValTool
       environment; this might result in NCL diagnostics being no longer functional for most users
     - the science team will create a list of essential NCL diagnostics (e.g. perfmetrics, IPCC diagnostics)
       that would need to be converted to e.g. Python; the corresponding GitHub discussion is available at
       https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions/2617
     - if possible, a priority should be assigned to each diagnostic to be converted based on e.g.
       scientific value, project deliverables, etc.
4. General questions and topics
   * Updating diagnostics for new datasets (e.g. CMIP6 instead of CMIP5) can be difficult and time consuming
   * Integration of IPCC AR6 diagnostics needs to be finished soon, in particular since some diagnostics are
     written in NCL (see item 3)
