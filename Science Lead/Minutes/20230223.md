2. Brief report on cross-team meeting from 2022-12-05 and 2023-01-30
[https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/blob/main/Cross%20Team/Minutes]
   * Funding opportunities: how and where to get funding
     - natESM (programming help to improve preprocessor) has been granted
     - different small scale funding opportunities in UK
	 - Horizon EU call is out: possibility to do evaluation with ESMValTool
	 - infrastructure call for 2024 might be another possibility
   * Redistribution of tier 3 datasets
     - making access to cmorized observational datasets easier on HPC systems
	 - contacting ~30 data provider (tier 3 datasets) and ask for permission to provide cmorized datasets on selected HPC systems
	 - so far, positiv feedback from 9/10 providers contacted
   * Update on consortium agreement and contributor license agreement (CLA)
	 - legal departments are in contact
     - aim: having consortium agreement in place by next workshop
   * Next ESMValTool workshop
     - 2-3 day workshop and a tutorial for SMHI people
     - planned for May/June at SMHI (Norrk√∂ping, Sweden), no exact dates yet
	 - hybrid format
	 - worskhop in fall 2023 might be online only
   * Tutorials and answering of questions
     - general tutorial planned for fall 2023
	 - WCRP academy: bringing together training providers and climate scientists, possibility for ESMValTool tutorial
	 - handling of questions on GitHub: approaching user engagement team if they would be fine picking up on unanswered questions and tagging people who might be able to provide an answer
3. ESMValTool release v2.8 
   * Prioritization of pull requests (and reviews) for release
   * Documentation updates
   * Website
     - GitHub pages website is now online (https://www.esmvaltool.org/)
	 - Website content needs updating (e.g. about, roadmap, cmip6 contribution, gallery)
	 - 2-hour sprint at the next workshop to update website content
   * Substantial changes to ESMValCore (PR #1609 [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/pull/1609])
     - recipes continue to work until v2.10 but might need updating
	 - handling of fx variables (now called supplementary variables) changed, improved flexibility
	 - support for wildcards (e.g. given variable and experiment: find all available datasets) but probably not acceptable for recipes used in publications
	 - offline option will be replace by search_esgf option (PR #1935 [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/pull/1935])
	 - tutorial might need to get updated
4. Scientific mid- to long-term strategy - where do we want to go, what are mid- and long-term scientific aims?
   * give feedback to technical lead team and update roadmap
   * road map from @hb326 would be a good start
   * science lead team meeting planned specifically on this point
5.	General questions and topics
