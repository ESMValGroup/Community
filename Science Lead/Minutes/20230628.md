## Topics

1. Upcoming release ESMValTool v2.10 (scheduled for Oct 2023)
   * Diagnostics and technical features needed for scientific analysis
     - ERA5 variable derivation (on the fly CMORizer)
	   [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/issues/1806]
     - Support for processing ERA5 grib files (precision problem + storage issues for hourly data)
       [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues/3238]
   * Update / extension of existing observational datasets
     - Make strategy more visible in documentation / obs policy
   * Project related work
     - Update of ESA CCI datasets
     - Handling of station data (e.g. Aeronet, methane); PR open
     - Implementation of chemical reanalysis data CAMS (ECMWF data, grib format)
     - EERIE task XP4.6 (baseline evaluation of the models)

2. Scientific mid- to long-term strategy - where do we want to go, what are mid- and long-term scientific aims?
   * Comments and feedback on preliminary road map
     [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions/3035]
   * Extending monitoring capabilities (e.g. avoid reprocessing of data) + generic diagnostics
   * Support for km-scale models: global and regional
   * Extending support for (more) unstructured grids
   * New diagnostics and datasets for evaluation of high-resolution model runs
   * Implementing high-res ocean reanalysis datasets
     - Strategy for data storage / data selection might be needed for new high-res datasets
   * Update road map
     - Remove road map from website until update is available

3. General questions and topics
   * Promote scientific development (coding workshops, summer schools, videos, etc.)
   * Link documentation and actual diagnostic code (e.g. adding links to diagnostic scripts
     listed in documentation)
	 - Update template / checklist for pull requests / tutorial (recipe documentation)
     - Science reviewers: ensure methodology is described properly (rephrase item in PR checklist)
