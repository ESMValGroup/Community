## Agenda and topics discussed

The only thing we talked about other than wishing each other happy new year, and complaining about the weather, was the potential, and
possible delay of v2.12 release by a few (roughly three) weeks, as prompted by @ehogan; this is due to the necessity to include
as many recipes as possible in the Recipe Test Workflow (RTW); @ehogan will have a chat with @sloosvel about this, and @valeriupredoi
offered to organize an extra TLT just before the release process starts, if need be.

AOB: @bettina-gier has kindly volunteered to organize the main ESMValTool call (many thanks, Tina!!)
