## Topics discussed

- Variable derivation for ERA5 in the fix (https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/issues/1806)? -> @bouweandela will at some point look into it
- @valeriupredoi: development dependencies test https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/issues/2492 - should run only on `main` nightly; @valeriupredoi will open a PR fixing this in CircleCI configuration
- @valeriupredoi: PRs that need ESMValCore a long time before release cycle https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/3697 - this is a fluffy topic that involves bugfix releases scheduled reguarily that, in turn, depends on the RTW (Recipe Test Workflow) that is still in prototype/pre-production, hence...
- ...we should have another look at the RTW PR in `main` https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/3210
- @valeriupredoi: ESMValTool ready for Python 3.12 bar `prospector` https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/3501 - the only showstopper is, as we mentioned, `prospector` which, according to @bouweandela, and everyone else, is a bit dead; @valeriupredoi will start the integration process of Ruff into Codacy (since we really want Codacy umbrella) after holidays in September;
- @schlunma: pin iris? https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/pull/2500 - that PR is now Ready-for_Review, it is great to have two supported Iris versions (latest, one before latest) but if API changes are large, we can go with just the latest on occasion (like now)
- @bouweandela: ESMValBot maintainance: the Bot needs updating (really old deps), and needs migration to the new Levante tenancy; @valeriupredoi will help with this September onwards
