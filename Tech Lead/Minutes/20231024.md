## Topics Discussed

- @zklaus: release situation for 2.10
  - things are a bit more difficult this time round (new names for obs4MIPS, changes to recipe handling) - @bouweandela fixed a couple issues; further help is needed
  - Some files are not found in the ``download`` directory if the ESGF node where the data is from is down
  - @bouweandela (and us) agrees we should get the ESMValCore release candidate out anyway - we'll test all recipes when CEDA comes back online
  - PRs to change obs4MIPS name changes (by Romain) - @bouweandela mentions we should merge them to get the data finding to be using modern names
  - a couple bottom lines: we'll test everything that don't need CEDA, and we'll get Core RC out
- @bouweandela: ESMValBot and the VM (former: Remi): we need one maintainer for these: V @valeriupredoi volunteers, Bouwe will meet V at some point talk about it;
- Mambafore: we'll stick with it for now, until major problems appear (if any)
- future releases: February and June 2024, but we need to find release managers - let's talk at the wider ESMValTool call!
- next call on November 7th (first Tuesday of the month), as scheduled (auto-invite should be on)
