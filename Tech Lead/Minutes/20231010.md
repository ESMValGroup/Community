## Topics Discussed
    
- @zklaus: release is on track, just one last PR to be merged (#2191) that is ready too to be merged (reviewed and ready)
- @zklaus: `orphan` label is indeed needed -> @vpredoi will put it in the labels list right now
- @schlunma - ERA5/Grib - PBs of ERA5 data provided by DKRZ, in GRIB file format;
  - use via`iris-grib` is the package needed to read GRIB files; finally the environment now works with `iris-grib`, only CircleCI tests are failing (local fine) - @bouweandela mentions the Circle Test is done in a pre-built container that may not have the dependency installed;
  - grid - ERA5 is on a reduced Gaussian grid, @schlunma wrote a bespoke regridder (lazy and all) that would be good to be in Scitools-Iris (at a later stage, after they have overhauled their regridders) - for now include it in a private function in ESMValCore (before inclusion in Iris)? Opinions below:
    - @zklaus: this is a useful functionality for other datasets, so probably not private
    - @schlunma: probably not a good idea to put in the ESMValCore mechanism (hard to get it out when time comes)
    - debating ensues...will add the conclusion
    - Decided: we have it as a public/tested regrid scheme
  - @zklaus Q: online download from CDS is the same as data from DKRZ? @schlunma A: yes, but there are more data available on DKRZ;
- @ehogan KGO solution: KGO recording solutions|See [ESMValTool: discussion: #3247](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions/3247) for the latest news -> please have a read and see if you can contribute! -> in terms of storage for KGOs, Zenodo may be a good solution (possible decided solution). Emma will test the few recipes in RTW with Zenodo first, and then we'll see.
- we will have another (special) TLT call in a fortnight's time!
