## Agenda
- Review of Pending Action Items - none
- @bouweandela: Announce release? Documentation already updated - no updates
- @ehogan: RTW
    - V, apologies for not getting in touch with you to discuss this before now! Can we discuss it during this meeting? :blush: We are using the GitHub REST API for the RTW [status report](https://esmvaltool.dkrz.de/shared/esmvaltool/rtw/status_report.html) and the documentation states that "you can authorize a GitHub App, which can then make API requests on your behalf.". How easy would it be to authorize the [esmvalbot](https://github.com/apps/esmvalbot) to do this for us?
    - @bouweandela: esmvalbot is a GitHub probot app and can already comment on issues, so it will probably be possible to use it; can also create new bot (see https://github.com/probot/probot, https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps#github-apps-that-act-on-their-own-behalf)
    - @bouweandela: Alternative: setup GitHub action that reads output from DKRZ and reports possible problems (open issues, see https://github.com/marketplace/actions/open-issue-action)
    - @ehogan: On DKRZ, usually only 5 jobs can be run in parallel (would take very long to run all recipes), but we have been given special settings to be able to run 50 jobs in parallel; needs to be implemented though
- @schlunma: this will probably be last TLT meeting before parental leave, will be back around December
