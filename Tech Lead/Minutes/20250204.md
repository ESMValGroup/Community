## Agenda and topics discussed

- Pending actions: both have been addressed: docs split will be started by @flicj91 (cheers!) and meeting about the Intake lib has happened
- @schlunma: broken recipes discussed in detail:
SLT discussed [broken recipe policy](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/community/broken_recipe_policy.html)
    - Current policy:
      - Broken recipe and diagnostic code are removed from the ESMValTool main branch
      -> @bouweandela raises the issue of complete removal (NOT for an example like Julia recipe!), there are ways of "archiving" old code but not removing, but those are difficult on the technical side
      - Scientific documentation of the recipe (and diagnostics) will be kept in the user and developer guide with an additional note and link to the last release in which the recipe was still fully functional
      -> @bouweandela: code will not actually work since deps are too old, unlikely to have an out-the-box solution - an idea to have them on Zenodo, @valeriupredoi: since both deps and data will become unavailable (could bundle conda-lock files) it'll be difficult
      - Policy does not cover the case of removing unused/outdated recipes/diagnostics from the testing and maintenance framework of the tool
   - Idea:
      - Introducing an "archive" folder in the ESMValTool repository (with subfolders "recipes" and "diagnostic_scripts")
      - Possibility to move broken/unused/outdated recipes and/or diagnostic scripts to this new folder (instead of deleting the code)
      - Reasons:
         - Make sure diagnostics and recipes that have been advertised in presentations and papers remain part of the ESMValTool distribution (as "inactive" components)
         - Ensure long-term and easiest possible access to old code for scientists
         - Make maintenance and testing of the tool as well as releases easier by retiring unused/outdated recipes (by the recipe maintainer)
      - Examples include recipes relying on CMIP5 data that are not available any more, the NCL-based "perfmetrics" package or @schlunma's paper from 2020
   - Special care has to be taken when retiring diagnostic scripts to avoid breaking of other diagnostics / recipes
   - The science team is in favor of this idea
      - @schlunma will report this idea at the next meeting of the Technical Lead Development Team (TLT)
      - Way forward is to open a pull request to adapt/extend the broken recipe policy
   - Need to have a final decision very soon: SLT have more or less decided on "archiving", TLT is discussing now, but as @bouweandela mentions - it's a joint TLT-SLT matter, so @valeriupredoi will set up a TLT-SLT call
- Upcoming release: RTW will not be used for this release (not all the recipes are there, there are a few teething issues that need ironing out - @sloosvel is opening issues, thank you!); @bouweandela mentions we could start setting it up (at least for "short" recipes); @sloosvel - MO have a GUI that could be ported - somewhere (@bouweandela: where though?) - that could be a good start; @sloosvel is running the RTW on about 100 "short" recipes on Levante, those can be used for the release, but there is little time to add the beefier ones before the release; @sloosvel will announce the release schedule soon.
- add Julien (SMHI) to the TLT - will ask him!
