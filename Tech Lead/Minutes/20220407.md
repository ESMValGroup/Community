## Agenda

### Attendance

Birgit, Klaus, Bouwe, Manu, Saskia, Emma, Remi, V

### Topics

- https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/issues/1542 
  - Manuel: all dependencies from Conda forge - outstanding issues: conda feedstock meta file has divergent packages list - lots from PyPi in `setup.py` - move all to env, careful with naming from PyPi vs CF - careful with non-Python deps (NCL, R stuff) 
  - so crack on with curr PR (just need to re-add deps in setup.py) and to the same for Tool
- CLA crappe: Birgit - the Consortium Agreement is almost done, CLA is being talked about - should have one single clickyty button on GH  
  - unless we have strong arguments against the CLA app suggested (CLA Auth)?
- Codacy discussion (Bouwe) https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/2527 : keep it high for Core, don't lower it! Maybe lower it for Tool? 
  - Klaus: it gets very hairy to maintain stuff that's badly written in Tool - fix a standard, whichever we decide on, best to fix it - timescale determined by the versions of the tools we use;
  - Reset to max Errs to 0 - even big errors go through (Bouwe); Remi, Klaus agree - Manu: how do you decide which goes through? 
  - **Vote** Tech team - voted to get it back to 0 yay
- Talk about big OBS files - open an issue for a better discussion; also, how to grab continually updated OBS data (and CMORize it and update our DB) - Remi: enough tech discussion especially lots are interested in the DB - MO, IPSL etc - Birgit: user point of view data stopping at 2014 is good fro CMIP6 - Manu: lots of changes to cmorizer scripts stemmed from hardcoded, custom vars etc (eg version) - Bouwe: two diff probs - distribution **and** data cmorization - for distribution Emma is interested to get smth like an online DB a la obs4MIPS - Klaus: get an rsync pull from DKRZ with account credentials, sort of a stop gap solution -> we will talk more (maybe at the Workshop in June)
- Have us a Tech meeting at the Workshop in June?

### TODO's/Outstanding

- OBS database/transfer and CMORization
- large OBS data files
- fix the deps from conda-forge only via PR's (Core has one, needs fixing by V; Tool needs one too)
