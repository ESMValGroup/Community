## Purpose of the meeting

We looked back on how the work leading to the release of
[v2.6](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/community/release_strategy.html#past-releases)
went and what we would like to improve for the next release.

## Action items for the next release

Overall, we felt that communication and collaboration could be improved.

- Communicate via issues/discussions for technical work, but schedule
  a face to face meeting if anyone involved has strong feelings about a topic.
  Make sure to summarize any decisions made outside GitHub in an issue, for
  future reference and to keep everyone in the loop.
- Tag specific people in issues/pull requests to attract their attention.
  If you are unsure who to tag, use the
  [Blame button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#viewing-the-line-by-line-revision-history-for-a-file)
  in the relevant files to see who has expertise on specific parts of the code.
  These people are good candidates to ask questions.
  On pull requests, GitHub will automatically suggest those people as
  reviewers.
  Have a look at our documentation on
  [reviewing pull requests](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/community/review.html)
  for a list of teams who can help with reviewing.
- A release is too much work to do alone, so the previous release manager
  needs to make sure they are involved and do the work together with the
  current release manager.
  If the current release manager does not (seem to be) asking for help, the
  previous release manager should be more active in offering it.
- The documentation on making a release needs to be updated, but note that
  this is intended more as a checklist than detailed guidance.
  The latter should be offered by the previous release manager.
