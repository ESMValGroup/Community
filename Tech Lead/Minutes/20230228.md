### Topics discussed

Topics added to the [discussion item page](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/discussions/79)

**General items**

- Bouwe: we should talk about what feature freeze etc - pre-release instructions
- Remi: talked about opening up Slack with the User Eng. Team: they recommended not opening it as a Helpdesk
        Bouwe thinks they got it wrong - Slack should be open for communication not as a Helpdesk
        Saskia: thinks it will eventually become a Helpdesk
        Remi: postpone discussion to workshop, a f2f
- Remi: Release schedule:
        Manu: change default for esgf download option (replace offline) - only problem is the Deprecation warning is printed twice
        V: issue with a few recipes prob bc of CanESM CCCMA crappe
- Remi: Core feature freeze tomorrow(ish) (March 1st 2023)
      Tool (targeted) feature freeze March 8
      gonna rename the Discussion item to Release something something (Bouwe suggested following iris procedures)
      
**Release documentation procedure**
 
 - Remi summarizing the procedure:
   - (Core) feature freeze -> no more changes apart from bugfixes
   - merge this in `main` -> RC -> test by running recipes -> if issues, bugfixes in core -> another RC -> ... -> final Core RC
   - (Tool) feature freeze -> final test all recipes ->
   - final Core release from last Core RC, final release for Tool **at the same time**
   - Important to keep the RM in the loop avoid major changes that diverge branches
   
**Release testing procedure (Tool)**

[Tool Documentation PR](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/3032)

- (ad-hoc) Data directories: issues with missing CMIP5 data at DKRZ -> centralize data dirs at DKRZ distill to two at most dirs
- Remi: handling of broken recipes: we should keep track of them and don't gloss over them every release
- Bouwe: add a table to the docs listing the broken recipes -> Remi: add criteria by which we list the broken ones (Core, data, diagnostic etc)
- how to run the recipes: ad-hoc scripts written by Saskia, used for 2.6 and 2.7 -> issues from greatly differing resources needed; scripts are PR-ed in https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/2883
- ideally we should have a single end-to-end workflow -> Bouwe suggesting dedicated workflow writers -> good idea, but we need discuss, maybe with the Met Office, not to duplicate MO work (which is currently suspended, anyway)
- maybe less use of Levante - although JASMIN is unreliable, and data is most plentiful on Levante
- possible come back to Cylc (8.0) but need to get in touch with Met Office
- Manu: add resource info in the recipe's header - rough numbers to give an idea about what it needs - Bouwe: maybe add that to the Debug Table - plop it in the documentation every latest/stable release

**Final temp solution: for now, use current ad-hoc solution - Bouwe suggests we merge those PRs that contain these scripts ie https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/pull/2883.**

Examining recipe runs results:
- who checks the recipe run output: ask support from the Science Team and Devs, allow for a few days for this to happen
- how to check: RM checks via a quick look - much more important for the recipe devs to look at output

esmvalcore pin in Tool is not stringent
