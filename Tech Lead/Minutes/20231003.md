## Agenda
- Review of Pending Action Items

We didn't get around to discussing @ehogan's items during this meeting, so they have been moved to the next meeting :blush:

## Topics discussed
    
### Review of Action Items
#### KGO Recording
Emma reports on her research. More details in the linked discussion.
Commercial solutions like AWS S3 or Git LFS at Github.com seem prohibitively expensive.

Possible candidate tools:
* https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/

Storage provider candidates:
* Zenodo
* b2share
    
#### Community review
Will be done when storage solution is in place.
    
#### Shared email account
no update
    
#### Docker community account
Approved by Docker
    
#### Pypi organization

#### Talk about GRIB and ERA5

### Upcoming release
The feature freeze for the Core should have happened yesterday.
Will be announced now.
Bouwe as previous release manager and Klaus as release manager will schedule a virtual meeting to kickstart the process.
We will push the feature freeze forward by one week.
