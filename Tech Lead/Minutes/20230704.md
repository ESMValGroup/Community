## Topics discussed

### Status of 2.9.0 release (@bouweandela)

- ESMValCore=2.9.0 is now released (on PyPI and conda-forge), currently runs on Levante going with new ESMValCore.
  Plan is to have ESMValTool released on Thursday 6 July 2023, including release on conda-forge. 
  Caveat emptor: we still have to understand the performance issues with the new Dask/iris combo.

### Changelog generation tools (@zklaus)

- Numpy, Pytest, Pip all use Towncrier.
  Dask (and Distributed) uses a git oneliner that produces something similar to what we are trying to replace, see [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/main/docs/release-procedure.md).
  Scipy seems to be doing it mostly manually, with a PR based list as a starting point for the maintainer.
- @zklaus suggests to adopt Towncrier. We can adapt a config from Numpy or Pytest, see [here](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6995257cf470d2143ad1683824962de4071c0eb7/pyproject.toml#L67).
- @zklaus giving us a more detailed set of instructions: one can put a bunch of `rst` files in a directory, then the Changelog file gets generated from these. 
  The rst files need a naming convention e.g. `<PULL REQUEST>.<TYPE>.rst` that gets piped to Towncrier.
- @bsolino asks: is this an extra layer on top of the automated bit? 
  @zklaus: it's an addition to the oldschool Changelog, some packages do this, as well as maintaining the oldschool Changelog. If one wants to have a look only at the commits, then commit log it.
- @bouweandela says: looks clean and user-oriented (very helpful for new users wanting to read what's actually been done in the past).
- @remi-kazeroni asks: when should we start adopting it?
  @zklaus: let's first decide to adopt it; if so, let's first do it for ESMValCore, as a testbed.
- @remi-kazeroni proposes an ad-hoc vote to adopt Towncrier.
- On an unrelated note, the search made me stumble over [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/); maybe worth checking out - for auto-downloads of data (maybe auxilary data as @bouweandela mentions).

**Vote result: unanimity for adoption!**
Therefore, we are aiming for first use next release (with Klaus as RM; he'll have done us a nice configuration for it). **Thanks a lot, Klaus!**

- [ ] **Action Item** @zklaus will investigate further and open a PR.

### Concatenation process improvements (@sloosvel)

There is room for improving the concatenation mechanism, both at ESMValCore, and iris ends. Proposal involving iris:
- iris ignores a number of netCDF attributes/coordinates, so we can use this method: check once for a certain attribute/coordinate validity, then ignore once the first check has passed;
  - @bouweandela responds: a bit clunky to configure this from the recipe layer - could be tied to the ``cmor_level__check``, we probably don't want to add extra user configuration;
  - @zklaus mentions using the netCDF layer (even before iris), but adds that the proper long term solution is to improve iris;
  - @sloosvel: proposing an interim solution to tie to the ``cmor_check_level`` option <-> @zklaus is a bit worried about the users' abuse of this option;
- @bouweandela proposes talking to the data providers to output fewer files:
  - @sloosvel says it could be a flat no, due to the data production setup that's optimized for their (data providers') needs;
  - @zklaus mentions that there is new data being produced, so the old infrastructure will probably not change;
- bottom line: raise this with iris and tell them to haul rears!

### Changing the Tier of an OBS dataset (@remi-kazeroni)

- @zklaus says: it's in the ``Dataset`` facet, manipulation can happen there but that needs to be done in the Core;
- @bouweandela: there are risks due to concatenation/merging of data from different Tiers if people store the same data in two different TierX folders.
  We could think of a new drs with no Tiers.
- @remi-kazeroni: that would be helpful for users not sharing data (i.e. working on personal computers). Tiers are mostly needed to share data on large clusters (e.g. DKRZ);
- @remi-kazeroni says: we should think more carefully about this. Note so easy to make it backward compatible (recipe-wise and OBS data pool-wise).

### AOB

- @bouweandela: Workshop announcement: *"Correctness and Reproducibility for Climate and Weather Software"* at NCAR, 9-10 November 2023. Deadline: August 1.
  - @valeriupredoi is willing to help writing an abstract.
