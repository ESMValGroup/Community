Steering Group Meetings
==========================

When the ESMValTool consortium is formally initiated, it will be overseen by a
Steering Group.
Information on the Steering Group meetings will appear here.

Prior to initiation of the steering group, a proto-Steering Group is developing
strategy and coordinating proposals. Information on that group can be found in 
[proto-Steering Group](proto-Steering%20Group/README.md)

The (proto-)steering group can be contacted via the two Co-PIs.
