Steering Group Meetings
==========================

Prior to initiation of the steering group, a proto-Steering Group is developing
strategy and coordinating proposals. Information on that group can be found
here. The proto-Steering Group succeeded a smaller group that coordinated
across the ESMValTool teams; information on that group's meetings can be found
in [Cross Team](../Cross%20Team/README.md).

The proto-Steering Group can be contacted via the two Co-PIs.
