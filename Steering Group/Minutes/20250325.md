### 2. **Update: REF and the early March hackathon** - BIRGIT

- Extremely valuable for talking, planning, deciding how to cover gaps etc.
- The REF timelines continue to be extremely tight
- Attempted to break REF for ESMValTool with hi-res data - and it didn't break!
- 1st March was the deadline for integrating all metrics

- Item 3 and 4 discussed together
- QUESTION: Are there opportunities for wider global engagement, e.g. the global south?
- ANSWER: Yes, definitely
- Birgit in contact with Brian Lawrence re: tweaking the Horizon proposal
- There may be an additional work package for training which could potentially accomodate global south
- ✏️ *Action:* **Birgit** to discuss the training work package with Anna and report back to Steering Group*
- ✏️ *Action:* **Everyone** Contact Birgit if willing to assist*

### 5. **Continue discussion of “approach for planning and reporting”** - ALISTAIR

- Picked up from discussion from Jan 28th's meeting (Meeting notes [here]( https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/blob/main/Steering%20Group/Minutes/20250128.md#3---partner-planning-and-reporting-of-effort--alistair))
- The group re-reviewed slides ([here](/files/ESMValTool_Consortium-planning_and_reporting.pdf))
- The following principles for collaboration were discussed and agreed:
    - **Trust**: a collaboration cannot work without it. 
    - **Fairness**: feelings of unfairness will erode willingness to contribute
    - **Confidence in capacity and capability**: we will have interdependencies and need to know we can rely on each other
    - **Transparency of plans and activity**: avoid duplication or gaps, and build trust and confidence
    - **Understanding**: that each partner has different priorities, and that their capacity and capabilities will vary in time
    - **Constructive challenge**: to raise concerns with each other and adjust course before trust and confidence break down

- Discussion of the principles touched upon:
    - Resources likely to be a moving target, changing over time. This is related to transparency.
    - E.g a consortimum member shared thoughts/efforts on improving their institute's ability to contribute more
    - It's ideal to have something in place to regularly check how people are feeling about the consortium, and to preempt issues before people get really angry!
    - A Steering Group culture of early challenging and an openness to being challenged was suggested
    - In person meetings mentioned as a vital part of open communication culture

- Alistair proposed the Steering Group develop three documents:
    - 1) **Long term strategy (for everybody)**
        - A quite mature draft already exists
    - 2) **Shared plan for short term work (for consortium partners)**
        - part of the transparency piece
        - detailing what we are each proposing to contribute
        - facilitate aligning goals of ESMValTool and goals of the specific projects often funding consortium members activity 
    - 3) **Retrospective report on consortium activity**
        - opportunity for transparency and to challenge early
        - what was actually done/were objectives met/what issues arose

- A key discussion point raised by Ranjini: 

> How we as representatives of consortium partner institutes were expected to "represent" our institutes and if there were some basic guidelines we all had to follow? 
>  - e.g report back after every meeting or such.
>  - We are not a big number as such but there is quite a bit of diversity in how our orgnaizations function and what career stage we are at within the organizational structure so this may be different for each of us. 
>  - So it might be good to have some structure in place as a baseline to ensure our institutes are all appropriately represented.

- ✏️ *Action:* **Everyone** reflect on the principles and what they might mean in practice for planning and reporting
- ✏️ *Action:* **Everyone** reflect specifically on the proposed three documents. Goal will be to discuss and agree which documents to create at next Steering Group meeting.
