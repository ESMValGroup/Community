# Survey questions

## Readme

This survey aims at evaluating users’ experiences with ESMValTool and
discovering users’ needs.  It is meant for the users of ESMValTool in all levels
of expertise. Some criteria to design the questions:

- It does not take more than 10 (?) minutes
- It does not have overlapping questions
- It does not include questions with yes/no answers
- It does not collect personal data, but it has some profiling questions
- It covers different aspects of ESMValTool like application, usage, documentation and community

The survey can be implemented in a survey app like surveymonkey that does not
collect personal data. The owner is “user engagement team”. They will
edit/run/evaluate the survey and communicate the results to other teams if
needed.

## Survey content

Hi! We in [ESMValGroup](https://www.esmvaltool.org/), would love to hear about
your research and experiences using ESMValTool. Here, there are a few questions
which help to create your story. Your answers will help us to improve ESMValTool

1. Can you describe your research/case study?
2. Can you underline the challenges in your research/case study?
3. How would you categorize your expertise level in using ESMValTool? (Beginner,
   competent practitioner, expert)
