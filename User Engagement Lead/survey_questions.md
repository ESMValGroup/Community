# Survey questions

## Readme

This survey aims at evaluating users’ experiences with ESMValTool and
discovering users’ needs.  It is meant for the users of ESMValTool in all levels
of expertise. Some criteria to design the questions:

- It does not take more than 10 (?) minutes
- It does not have overlapping questions
- It does not include questions with yes/no answers
- It does not collect personal data, but it has some profiling questions
- It covers different aspects of ESMValTool like application, usage, documentation and community

The survey can be implemented in a survey app like surveymonkey that does not
collect personal data. The owner is “user engagement team”. They will
edit/run/evaluate the survey and communicate the results to other teams if
needed.
