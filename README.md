ESMValTool Community Discussion
===============================

This repository is used for discussion, announcements, and other community based activities.

This issue tracker is intended to be low-to-medium traffic. Here are some proposed uses:

1. Announcing meetings and sharing meeting notes
2. Announcing workshops
3. Discussing conferences

We hope that by removing these discussions from the high-traffic
[ESMValGroup/ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues) issue tracker that more people
will feel comfortable subscribing to them.

Tech lead team meetings
-----------------------

More information about the technical lead team meetings can be found in [Tech Lead](Tech%20Lead/README.md).
