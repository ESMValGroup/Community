ESMValTool Community Discussion
===============================

This repository is used for discussion, announcements, and other community based activities.

This issue tracker is intended to be low-to-medium traffic. Here are some proposed uses:

1. Announcing meetings and sharing meeting notes
2. Announcing workshops
3. Discussing conferences

We hope that by removing these discussions from the high-traffic
[ESMValGroup/ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues) issue tracker more people
will feel comfortable subscribing to them.

Monthly ESMValTool meetings
---------------------------

Format and agenda

- Anyone with an interest in ESMValTool is welcome to join and ask questions
- We start the meeting by doing a round where everyone gets one minute to introduce themselves and tell what they will be working on in the next month or what they would like help with.
- Using the input from the introduction round, we can decide to talk about specific topics with the entire group or make smaller breakout groups to continue the discussion there.
- GitHub issues ([ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues)/[ESMValCore](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore/issues)) are our preferred way to communicate outside the meeting and keep track of work, so any feature requests/action items/etc discussed in the meeting should ideally result in a GitHub issue.
- If you already know that you would like to bring up a particular topic in the meeting, you can mention it in the GitHub discussion announcing the meeting. That will make it easy to find for other people in the meeting and we can already start discussing there before the meeting. If you expect there might be a lot of discussion on the topic, you might want to create a new [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions) for it and link it from the meeting announcement disucssion.

Calendar invitations to the meeting are sent to the mailing list, join it [here](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/introduction.html#user-mailing-list).
